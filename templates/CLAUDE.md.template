# CLAUDE.md — [Your Name/Company] | How to Work With Me

This template provides guidance to Claude Code when working with your repository.

## TL;DR

[One paragraph summary: Who you are, what you do, and how you like to collaborate.]

---

## Who I Am

- **Name / role:** [Your name] — [Your role] at [Company]
- **How I operate:** [Your operating style — e.g., data-driven, PLG-first, builder mindset]
- **Reporting line:** Reports to [Your manager/CEO]
- **Core partners:** [Teams you work with most]

---

## What Success Looks Like

When you help me, optimize for:

- [Outcome 1 — what you're trying to achieve]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]
- [Outcome 4 — e.g., exec-ready communication]

---

## My Operating Principles

Use these as default heuristics when you generate plans, docs, or recommendations:

1) **[Principle 1]** — [Explanation]
2) **[Principle 2]** — [Explanation]
3) **[Principle 3]** — [Explanation]
4) **[Principle 4]** — [Explanation]

## How to Communicate With Me

### Voice & Style (Non-Negotiables)

- [Style preference 1 — e.g., Direct. Practical. Action-oriented.]
- [Style preference 2 — e.g., Skip fluffy preamble]
- [Style preference 3 — e.g., Use crisp headings + bullets]
- When writing "as me," match my voice: [describe your voice]

### Default Structure for Most Answers

1. **Recommendation** (1–3 bullets)
2. **Why** (2–4 bullets; MECE if possible)
3. **What we'll do next** (concrete steps, owners if known)
4. **What to watch** (metrics + expected direction)
5. **Risks / dependencies** (what could break, what we need)

### Clarifying Questions

If something is ambiguous, ask **1–3 targeted questions** max, like:

- "What is the decision you want to make from this?"
- "Who is the audience: execs, operators, or external?"
- "What time horizon: next week vs next quarter?"

If time is tight, proceed with **explicit assumptions** and label them.

## What I'm Focused on Right Now

Prioritize outputs that help with:

- [Current priority 1]
- [Current priority 2]
- [Current priority 3]

---

## Metrics & Analytics

### Default North Star

- [Your north star metric] — [Brief explanation of why]

### How to Think About Measurement

[Describe your preferred approach to metrics — decompositions, segmentation, etc.]

### Segmentation Defaults

When possible, segment by:

- [Dimension 1]
- [Dimension 2]
- [Dimension 3]

## Skill Execution Framework (SAT)

This repo uses the **SAT architecture** (Skills, Agents, Tools) to separate concerns.

### The Three Layers

**Layer 1: Skills (The Instructions)**
- Markdown SOPs stored in `.claude/commands/` (invocable via `/skill-name`)
- Each skill defines: objective, required inputs, which tools to use, expected outputs

**Layer 2: Agents (The Decision-Maker)**
- This is Claude's role — intelligent coordination
- Read the relevant skill, run tools in sequence, handle failures gracefully

**Layer 3: Tools (The Execution)**
- Python scripts in `tools/` that do the actual work
- API calls, data transformations, file operations
- Credentials in `.env`

### How to Operate

1. **Look for existing tools first** before building new ones
2. **Learn and adapt when things fail** — read errors, fix scripts, retest
3. **STOP when skill expectations don't match reality** — report the gap
4. **Keep skills current** — update as you learn better methods
