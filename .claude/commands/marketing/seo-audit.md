# SEO Audit Command

Conducts comprehensive SEO audits for external consulting clients. Advisory-only workflow: structured intake → guided analysis → xlsx output with exec summary.

## Workflow Overview

```
1. INTAKE → User provides data via structured Google Sheet
2. ANALYSIS → Work through priority-ordered audit framework
3. OUTPUT → Generate .xlsx file (via document-skills:xlsx) + executive summary
```

---

## 1. Intake Requirements

### Ideal Data Sources

Request client provide a Google Sheet with the following tabs/exports:

| Tab | Source | Contents |
|-----|--------|----------|
| GSC Performance | Google Search Console → Performance → Export | Queries, pages, clicks, impressions, CTR, avg position (last 90 days) |
| GA4 Landing Pages | GA4 → Reports → Engagement → Landing Pages → Export | Landing pages, sessions, engagement rate, conversions |
| Site Info | Manual | Domain, CMS, hosting, known issues, priority pages |
| Keyword Targets | Manual | Current target keywords, priority/tier, current ranking if known |
| Competitors | Manual | 3-5 competitor URLs for comparison |

### Fallback for Limited Access

If client lacks GSC/GA4 access:
- Manual completion of Site Info tab (domain, CMS, known issues, priority pages)
- Screenshots of key GSC/GA4 reports
- List of 10-20 target keywords with expected intent
- Competitor URLs for manual comparison

### Intake Questions

Ask before starting analysis:
1. What is the primary business goal for this site? (leads, sales, awareness, etc.)
2. What are your top 3 priority pages or content areas?
3. Any known technical issues or recent site changes?
4. Who is the target audience / ideal customer?
5. What CMS/platform is the site built on?

## 2. Audit Framework

Work through in priority order. For each area, document:
- **Issue**: What's wrong
- **Impact**: High / Medium / Low
- **Evidence**: Data or observation supporting the finding
- **Fix**: Specific recommendation
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low

### Priority 1: Crawlability & Indexation

- [ ] User-agent rules are correct (not blocking Googlebot)

**XML Sitemap Checks:**
- [ ] Sitemap exists and is valid XML

### Priority 2: Technical Foundations
