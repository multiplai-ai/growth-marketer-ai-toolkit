# Google Ads Deep Analysis

## Process

1. Collect Google Ads account data (export, Change History, Search Terms Report)
2. Read `ads/references/google-audit.md` for full 74-check audit
3. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for Google-specific benchmarks
4. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring
5. Evaluate all applicable checks as PASS, WARNING, or FAIL
6. Calculate Google Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Generate findings report with action plan

## What to Analyze

### Conversion Tracking (25% weight)
- Google tag (gtag.js) installed and firing on all pages
- Enhanced Conversions active (hashed first-party data)
- Consent Mode v2 implemented (required for EU/EEA)
- Conversion actions mapped correctly (primary vs secondary)
- Offline conversion import configured (for lead gen)
- Server-side tagging via GTM (recommended for accuracy)
- Attribution model: data-driven preferred (last-click as fallback only)
- Conversion lag analysis (are conversions still trickling in?)

### Wasted Spend (20% weight)
- Search Terms Report reviewed (last 30 days minimum)
- Negative keyword coverage adequate (shared lists + campaign-level)
- Display placement audit (exclude low-quality sites)
- Invalid click rate within norms (<10%)
- Broad Match only used with Smart Bidding (NEVER without it)
- Brand/non-brand campaigns separated
- Geographic targeting precise (no wasted international spend)

### Account Structure (15% weight)
- Campaign-level organization follows business logic
- Ad groups themed tightly (15-20 keywords max per group)
- RSA ad groups have ≥3 active ads
- PMax campaigns structured correctly (asset groups, signals)
- SKAGs evaluated (migrate to themed groups if present)
- Campaign labels/naming conventions consistent

### Keywords (15% weight)
- Match type strategy appropriate (Exact → Phrase → Broad progression)
- Quality Score distribution (aim ≥7 average)
- Low QS keywords flagged (<5 = FAIL, 5-6 = WARNING)
- Keyword cannibalization check (same keywords in multiple campaigns)
- Impression share tracked for top keywords
- Keyword bid adjustments set for devices/locations/audiences

### Ads (15% weight)
- RSA: ≥8 unique headlines, ≥3 descriptions per ad group
- RSA: ad strength "Good" or "Excellent" (not "Poor" or "Average")
- Pin usage minimal and strategic (over-pinning reduces RSA flexibility)
- Ad extensions: sitelinks (≥4), callouts (≥4), structured snippets, image
- Dynamic keyword insertion used appropriately
- Ad copy includes CTA, value proposition, differentiators

### Settings (10% weight)
- Bid strategy appropriate for campaign maturity and goals
- Budget pacing: no campaigns limited by budget (unless intentional)
- Ad schedule aligned with business hours/conversion patterns
- Device bid adjustments set based on performance data
- Location targeting: "Presence" not "Presence or Interest"
- Network settings: Search Partners reviewed, Display opt-out for Search

## PMax Deep Dive

If Performance Max campaigns exist, additionally evaluate:
- Asset group diversity (text, images, video, feeds)
- Audience signals configured (custom segments, lists, demographics)
- URL expansion settings reviewed (opt-out of irrelevant pages)
- Brand exclusions applied (prevent cannibalizing brand search)
- Search themes utilized (2024 feature)
- Final URL expansion: enabled or disabled with justification
- Insights tab reviewed (search categories, audience segments)

## AI Max for Search (2026)

If AI Max for Search is available/active:
- Broad Match + AI Max integration evaluated
- Auto-generated headline performance monitored
- Search term categories reviewed for relevance
- Budget impact assessed (AI Max can shift spend)

## Key Thresholds

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| Quality Score (avg) | ≥7 | 5-6 | <5 |
| CTR (Search) | ≥6.66% | 3-6.66% | <3% |
| CVR (Search) | ≥7.52% | 3-7.52% | <3% |
| CPC (Search) | ≤$5.26 | $5.26-8.00 | >$8.00 |
| Wasted Spend | <10% | 10-20% | >20% |
| Ad Strength | Good+ | Average | Poor |
| Invalid Clicks | <5% | 5-10% | >10% |
