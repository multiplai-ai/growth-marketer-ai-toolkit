# LinkedIn Ads Deep Analysis

## Process

1. Collect LinkedIn Ads data (Campaign Manager export, Insight Tag status)
2. Read `ads/references/linkedin-audit.md` for full 25-check audit
3. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for LinkedIn-specific benchmarks
4. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring
5. Evaluate all applicable checks as PASS, WARNING, or FAIL
6. Calculate LinkedIn Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Generate findings report with action plan

- ABM company lists uploaded (up to 300,000 companies) (L07)
- Audience expansion OFF for precision campaigns, ON for scale (L08)
- Predictive audiences tested — replaced Lookalikes Feb 2024 (L09)

### Creative Quality (20% weight)
- Thought Leader Ads active, ≥30% budget allocation for B2B (L10)
- Ad format diversity: ≥2 formats tested (L11)
- Video ads tested (L12)
- Creative refresh every 4-6 weeks (L13)

- Demographics report reviewed monthly (L25)

## Thought Leader Ads (TLA) Assessment

Thought Leader Ads use employee/executive personal posts as sponsored content:
- CPC typically $2.29-$4.14 vs $13.23 for standard Sponsored Content
- CTR typically 2-3x higher than corporate-branded ads
- Best for: B2B thought leadership, brand awareness, engagement

Evaluate:
- Are TLAs being used? (If not, HIGH priority recommendation)
- Are they getting ≥30% of total LinkedIn budget?
- Are the right employees selected (industry credibility, active posters)?
- Is post content authentic and valuable (not salesy)?

## ABM Strategy Assessment

For B2B Enterprise accounts:
- Company list uploaded and segmented by tier (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Custom content per tier (personalized messaging)
- Account penetration tracking (contacts reached per target account)
- Integration with CRM/ABM platform (Demandbase, 6sense, etc.)
