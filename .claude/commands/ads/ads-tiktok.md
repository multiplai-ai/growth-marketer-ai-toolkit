# TikTok Ads Deep Analysis

## Process

1. Collect TikTok Ads data (Ads Manager export, Pixel/Events API status)
2. Read `ads/references/tiktok-audit.md` for full 25-check audit
3. Read `ads/references/benchmarks.md` for TikTok-specific benchmarks
4. Read `ads/references/platform-specs.md` for creative specifications
5. Read `ads/references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring algorithm
6. Evaluate all applicable checks as PASS, WARNING, or FAIL
7. Calculate TikTok Ads Health Score (0-100)
8. Generate findings report with action plan

## What to Analyze

### Creative Quality (30% weight)
- ≥6 creatives per ad group (T05) — Critical

- Safe zone compliance: X:40-940, Y:150-1470 (T25)

### Technical Setup (25% weight)
- TikTok Pixel installed and firing on all pages (T01)
- Events API + ttclid passback active (T02)
- Standard events configured (ViewContent, AddToCart, Purchase, CompleteRegistration)
- Advanced matching parameters configured

### Bidding & Budget (20% weight)

- Daily budget ≥50x target CPA per ad group (T12)
- Learning phase: ≥50 conversions per 7 days per ad group (T13)

## Creative-First Strategy

TikTok is a creative-first platform. Unlike Google/Meta where targeting and bidding
drive most performance, TikTok success depends primarily on creative quality.

### What Makes a TikTok Ad Work
- **Native feel**: looks like organic content, not a polished ad
- **Sound-on**: 93% of TikTok is consumed with sound (never run silent)
- **Fast hooks**: capture attention in 1-2 seconds or lose the viewer
- **Trend alignment**: use trending sounds, formats, and editing styles
- **UGC style**: user-generated content outperforms studio content
- **Vertical only**: 9:16 is non-negotiable (no letterboxed horizontal)

### Creative Testing Framework
1. Test 3-5 hooks per winning concept
2. Rotate creatives every 5-7 days (fatigue sets in fast)
3. Kill underperformers after 3 days if CTR <0.5%
4. Scale winners by duplicating (not increasing budget on same ad)
5. Repurpose winning concepts, not assets (fresh footage, same angle)

## Safe Zone

All critical text, logos, and CTAs must be within the safe zone:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│   UNSAFE (status)    │  Y: 0-150px
├──────────────────────┤
│                 │UNSA│
│                 │FE  │
│   SAFE ZONE     │icon│  X: 40-940px
│   900×1320px    │    │  Y: 150-1470px
│                 │    │
│                 │    │  Right 140px: like/comment/share
├──────────────────────┤
│   UNSAFE (caption)   │  Y: 1470-1920px
└──────────────────────┘
```

## Smart+ Campaigns

- Average ROAS: 1.41-1.67
- Best for: e-commerce with product feed, app installs
