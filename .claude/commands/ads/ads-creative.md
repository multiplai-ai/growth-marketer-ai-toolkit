## Universal Creative Best Practices

### Cross-Platform Safe Zone
- 900x1000px usable area works across all vertical placements
- Keep critical elements centered and within safe margins
- Test on mobile devices (75%+ of ad impressions are mobile)

### Ad Copy Principles
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Include clear CTA (what should they do next?)
- Match ad message to landing page (message match)
- Use numbers and specifics over vague claims
- Test emotional vs rational appeals

### Video Production Standards
- H.264 codec, AAC audio, MP4 container
- Minimum 720p (1080p preferred)
- Subtitles/captions always (accessibility + sound-off viewing)
- Brand mention within first 5s (awareness) or at CTA (performance)
