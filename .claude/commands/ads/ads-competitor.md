## Competitive Analysis Framework

### 1. Ad Copy Analysis
For each competitor, document:
- **Headlines**: primary messages and value propositions
- **CTAs**: what action they're driving (free trial, demo, buy now, learn more)
- **Offers**: pricing, discounts, free shipping, trials
- **Tone**: professional, casual, urgent, educational, emotional
- **USPs**: unique selling propositions they emphasize
- **Pain points**: customer problems they address

### 2. Creative Strategy Analysis
- **Formats used**: image, video, carousel, collection, document
- **Visual style**: photography, illustration, UGC, stock, branded
- **Video approach**: studio quality vs UGC vs animated
- **Creative volume**: how many active ads (indicator of testing velocity)
- **Refresh frequency**: how often new creatives appear

### 3. Messaging Themes
Categorize competitor messaging into themes:
| Theme | Competitor A | Competitor B | Your Brand |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Price/Value | ✅ Primary | ⚠️ Secondary | ? |
| Quality/Premium | ❌ | ✅ Primary | ? |
| Speed/Convenience | ⚠️ Secondary | ❌ | ? |
| Trust/Authority | ✅ Primary | ✅ Primary | ? |
| Innovation | ❌ | ⚠️ Secondary | ? |

### 4. Keyword Intelligence (Google/Microsoft)
- Brand keyword bidding: are competitors bidding on your brand?
- Keyword overlap: which non-brand terms do you both target?
- Keyword gaps: terms competitors rank for that you don't target
- Match type strategy: estimated match types from ad triggers

### 5. Spend Estimation
- Meta Ad Library shows spend ranges for political/social ads
- Google Auction Insights + impression share = directional spend estimate
- Third-party tools (SEMrush, SpyFu) for more precise estimates
- Manual estimation formula:
  ```
  Estimated Monthly Spend = Impressions × CPM / 1000
  or
  Estimated Monthly Spend = Clicks × Estimated CPC
  ```

## Gap & Opportunity Identification

### Platform Gaps
- Which platforms are competitors NOT on? (opportunity to own)
- Which platforms are they underspending on? (opportunity to outspend)

### Messaging Gaps
- What customer pain points are NO competitors addressing?
- What value propositions are underrepresented in the market?
- What content formats are competitors not using?

### Audience Gaps
- What demographics/segments are competitors not targeting?
- What geographic markets are underserved?
- What funnel stages are competitors neglecting?

### Creative Gaps
- What ad formats are competitors not using? (video, UGC, Spark Ads)
- What creative styles are missing from the competitive landscape?
- What platform-specific features are competitors not leveraging?

## Competitive Response Strategy

### When Competitors Bid on Your Brand
- Always run brand campaigns to defend (low CPC, high CTR)
- Dynamic keyword insertion to show your brand prominently
- Sitelinks to key pages (pricing, features, reviews)
- Ad copy that emphasizes unique differentiators
- Consider bidding on competitor brand terms (know the rules)

### When You're Outspent
- Focus on efficiency over volume (better targeting, creative, landing pages)
- Target long-tail keywords competitors ignore
- Use Exact match for precision (less waste)
- Double down on retargeting (lower CPA than prospecting)
- Compete on creative quality, not budget
