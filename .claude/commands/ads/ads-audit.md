# Full Multi-Platform Ads Audit

## Process

1. **Collect account data** — request exports, screenshots, or API access
2. **Detect business type** — analyze account signals per ads orchestrator
3. **Identify active platforms** — determine which platforms are in use
4. **Delegate to subagents** (if available, otherwise run inline sequentially):
   - `audit-google` — Conversion tracking, wasted spend, structure, keywords, ads, settings (G01-G74)
   - `audit-meta` — Pixel/CAPI health, creative fatigue, structure, audience (M01-M46)
   - `audit-creative` — LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft creative checks + cross-platform synthesis
   - `audit-tracking` — LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft tracking + cross-platform tracking health
   - `audit-budget` — LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft budget/bidding + cross-platform allocation
   - `audit-compliance` — All-platform compliance, settings, performance benchmarks
5. **Score** — calculate per-platform and aggregate Ads Health Score (0-100)
6. **Report** — generate prioritized action plan with Quick Wins

## Data Collection

Ask the user for available data. Accept any combination:
- Google Ads: account export, Change History, Search Terms Report
- Meta Ads: Ads Manager export, Events Manager screenshot, EMQ scores
- LinkedIn Ads: Campaign Manager export, Insight Tag status
- TikTok Ads: Ads Manager export, Pixel/Events API status
- Microsoft Ads: account export, UET tag status, import validation results

If no exports available, audit from screenshots or manual data entry.

```
