# Content Campaign

Plan and brief coordinated content campaigns for launches, series, and events. Produces campaign briefs with launch tier assignments, GACCS briefs, asset lists, and success metrics.

**When to use:** When planning a coordinated content push — product launches, content series, event promotions, or any multi-piece effort that needs more coordination than the regular calendar.

**Cadence:** As needed. Not a regular cadence — triggered by launches, series, or events.

**Recommended prerequisite:** Run `/content-strategy` first for pillars and distribution tiers.

---

## Philosophy

This skill is **opinionated**. Campaigns fail when everything is treated as equally important. The tier system forces honest prioritization.

**Core principles:**
1. **Not everything is a Tier 1 launch.** If everything is a big deal, nothing is. 1-2 Tier 1 campaigns per year, max.
2. **GACCS before assets.** Define what you're trying to achieve before listing what you need to make.
3. **Earned reach > paid reach for personal brands.** The LinkedIn flywheel (organic → Thought Leader Ads → engager qualification) compounds. Pure paid does not.
4. **Define failure upfront.** If you don't know what failure looks like, you can't learn from it.

## Workflow Overview

```
/content-campaign runs:

1. LOAD CONTEXT       → Read content-strategy + current calendar
2. CAMPAIGN SCOPING   → Define what, type, when, DRI
3. LAUNCH TIER        → Assign Tier 1/2/3 based on scope
4. CAMPAIGN GACCS     → Full brief (goal, audience, creative, channels, stakeholders)
5. ASSET LIST         → Generate tier-appropriate asset list with owners + deadlines
6. LINKEDIN FLYWHEEL  → Plan organic → TL Ads → engager qualification (optional)
7. SUCCESS METRICS    → Define success and failure criteria
```

# Phase 1: Load Context

Before building a campaign, load relevant strategy and calendar context.

### Check for Artifacts

1. **Content Strategy:** `{entity-dir}/strategy/content-strategy.md` (e.g., `strategy/content-strategy.md`)
   - Extract: pillars, distribution tiers, perceptions, principles

2. **Current Calendar:** `content/calendar-YYYY-MM.md` (current month)
   - Extract: theme, scheduled content, available slots

3. **Brand Strategy:** `{entity-dir}/strategy/brand-strategy.md` (e.g., `strategy/brand-strategy.md`)
   - Extract: message hierarchy, key messages, USPs

**If strategy found:**
Display summary: "Loaded content strategy + [month] calendar. [N] slots available this month."

**If not found:**
Display: "No content strategy found. I'll work with your inputs. Recommend running `/content-strategy` for distribution tiers and pillar alignment."

Proceed regardless — campaigns can work standalone.

# Phase 2: Campaign Scoping

Define the campaign's basic parameters.

### Scoping Workshop

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CAMPAIGN SCOPING — What Are We Launching?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. WHAT IS THE CAMPAIGN?
   What are you launching, promoting, or building momentum for?
   →

2. CAMPAIGN TYPE:
   [ ] Product launch (new product, feature, or major update)
   [ ] Content series (multi-part content with a theme)
   [ ] Event promotion (webinar, workshop, conference talk)
   [ ] Brand moment (milestone, announcement, thought leadership push)
   [ ] Partnership/collab (joint effort with another brand/person)

3. TIMELINE:
   - Start date: ___
   - End date: ___
   - Key milestone dates: ___

4. DRI (Directly Responsible Individual):
   Who owns this campaign end-to-end?
   →

5. BUDGET:
   - $0 (organic only)
   - $100-500 (light paid amplification)
   - $500-2000 (meaningful paid + tools)
   - $2000+ (significant investment)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

# Phase 3: Launch Tier Assignment

Assign a tier based on campaign scope. The skill recommends; the user confirms.

### Launch Tier Framework

| Tier | Frequency | Scope | Channels | Assets | Budget |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Tier 1** | 1-2/year | All channels, multi-week buildup, maximum effort | All owned + paid + earned + outreach | 8-12 assets | $1000+ |
| **Tier 2** | 1/quarter | Email + social + 1-2 additional, dedicated assets | Owned + select paid | 4-6 assets | $200-1000 |
| **Tier 3** | Monthly+ | Publish + share on owned channels | Owned only | 2-3 assets | $0-200 |

### Tier Recommendation Logic

Score based on:

| Factor | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Strategic importance | Critical to annual goals | Important to quarterly goals | Supports ongoing goals |
| Audience impact | New audience acquisition | Existing audience deepening | Audience maintenance |
| Revenue potential | Direct revenue or major pipeline | Pipeline contribution | Brand building |
| Effort justified | Yes — worth weeks of prep | Yes — worth a week of prep | Handled in normal flow |
| Novelty | First time, landmark moment | Notable but not unprecedented | Regular cadence |

### Display Format

```markdown
## Launch Tier Assignment

**Campaign:** [Name]
**Recommended Tier:** [1 / 2 / 3]

**Scoring:**
| Factor | Assessment | Points |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Strategic importance | [Assessment] | [1-3] |
| Audience impact | [Assessment] | [1-3] |
| Revenue potential | [Assessment] | [1-3] |
| Effort justified | [Assessment] | [1-3] |
| Novelty | [Assessment] | [1-3] |
| **Total** | | **[X/15]** |

**Tier thresholds:** 12-15 = Tier 1 / 8-11 = Tier 2 / 5-7 = Tier 3

**What this tier means:**
- Channels: [What's included]
- Assets: [How many to create]
- Timeline: [How much prep time]
- Budget: [Expected investment]

Confirm tier or adjust?

- LinkedIn Flywheel (Organic → TL Ads → Engager Qualification → Outreach)
- Asset list templates by tier
- Success/failure metric definition
```

---

# Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Campaign type is clearly defined (launch, series, event, brand moment, partnership)
- [ ] Tier assignment is honest (not everything is Tier 1)
- [ ] GACCS brief has all 5 elements filled with specifics (no "TBD")
- [ ] Asset list matches the assigned tier (not over-scoped for Tier 3, not under-scoped for Tier 1)
- [ ] Every asset has an owner and a deadline
- [ ] Success metrics include a failure definition (not just success)
- [ ] LinkedIn flywheel is included only when budget supports it
- [ ] Post-campaign review date is scheduled
- [ ] Campaign connects to content calendar (doesn't exist in isolation)
- [ ] Timeline is realistic given asset count and available resources

---

# Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

**DON'T:**
- Treat every launch as Tier 1 (inflation kills urgency)
- Skip the GACCS brief ("we'll figure it out as we go")
- Create 12 assets for a Tier 3 campaign (scope matches tier)
- Define only success metrics (define failure too)
- Plan the LinkedIn flywheel without budget for Thought Leader Ads
- Launch a campaign disconnected from the content calendar
- Create assets without owners or deadlines

**DO:**
- Be honest about tier assignment (most things are Tier 2 or 3)
- Complete the GACCS brief before listing assets
- Match asset count to tier scope
- Define what failure looks like so you can learn from it
- Use the LinkedIn flywheel only when budget supports it
- Overlay campaigns onto the existing calendar
- Schedule a post-campaign review

---

# Quick Actions
