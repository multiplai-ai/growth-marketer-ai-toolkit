# Content Calendar

Build a monthly content calendar from your content strategy. Produces a 4-week calendar with themed content, GACCS briefs, distribution plans, and mileage maps. Enforces production constraints.

**When to use:** At the start of each month to plan that month's content production. Pull from content strategy for pillars, shows, and themes.

**Cadence:** Monthly. Run in the last week of the preceding month.

**Recommended prerequisite:** Run `/content-strategy` first. Can work without it using defaults.

---

## Philosophy

This skill is **opinionated**. It enforces constraints that prevent the most common content failures: overproduction, lack of focus, and zero repurposing.

**Core principles:**
1. **One theme, one month.** A month-long theme creates compounding — each piece reinforces the others.
2. **Anchor first, derivatives second.** Start with the best piece and extract everything else from it.
3. **Redistribute, don't just create.** At least 2 slots per month should feature existing content, not new.
4. **Constraints are features.** Max 5 new pieces per week. The 30% juice rule. These protect quality.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
/content-calendar runs:

1. LOAD STRATEGY     → Read content-strategy artifact
2. THEME SELECTION   → Pick monthly theme from strategy rubric
3. GACCS BRIEF       → Full brief for the month's anchor piece
4. CALENDAR BUILD    → Map 4 weeks x shows (from strategy)
5. DISTRIBUTION PLAN → Assign tiers + channels per piece
6. MILEAGE MAP       → Plan repurposing chain (1 anchor → 3+ derivatives)
7. EXISTING CONTENT  → Identify redistribution slots
8. EXPORT            → Push to production pipeline
```

# Phase 1: Load Strategy Context

Before building the calendar, load the content strategy.

### Check for Content Strategy

Look for: `{entity-dir}/strategy/content-strategy.md` (e.g., `strategy/content-strategy.md`)

**If found:**
Extract:
- Content pillars (with funnel + perception mapping)
- Show definitions (cadences, platforms, formats)
- Distribution tier defaults
- Monthly theme rubric
- Pillar rotation tracker (last featured dates)
- Content principles

Display summary and confirm: "Strategy loaded. Ready to build the [Month] calendar?"

**If not found:**
Display: "No content strategy found. I'll use defaults:
- **Pillars:** AI-Native Growth Systems, Healthcare Growth Playbooks, Scaling-Stage Lessons, Industry POV, Builder Stories
- **Shows:** Saturday essay, Monday engagement, Wednesday visual, Thursday promo
- **Distribution:** Substack + LinkedIn + Twitter (Tier 1)

Recommend running `/content-strategy` for a stronger foundation. Proceed with defaults? [Yes/No]"

### Also Load

- `{entity-dir}/strategy/brand-strategy.md` — for message hierarchy and perceptions (if exists)
- `content/production-log.md` — to check what's been published recently (if exists)

---

# Phase 2: Monthly Theme Selection

Pick the theme for this month using the strategy's rubric.

### Theme Generation

Generate 3-4 candidate themes based on:

1. **Pillar Rotation (40%):** Which pillar hasn't been featured recently? Check rotation tracker.
2. **Perception Reinforcement (35%):** Which perception statement needs the most reinforcement? Check if any perception has been underserved.
3. **Timeliness (25%):** What's happening in the market/industry that creates urgency or relevance?

### Display Format

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MONTHLY THEME CANDIDATES — [Month Year]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Based on your strategy, here are theme candidates:

1. [THEME NAME]
   Pillar: [Pillar] (last featured: [Month])
   Perception: [Which perception it serves]
   Timeliness: [Why now]
   Score: [Weighted score]

2. [THEME NAME]
   Pillar: [Pillar] (last featured: [Month])
   Perception: [Which perception it serves]
   Timeliness: [Why now]
   Score: [Weighted score]

3. [THEME NAME]
   Pillar: [Pillar] (last featured: [Month])
   Perception: [Which perception it serves]
   Timeliness: [Why now]
   Score: [Weighted score]

RECOMMENDED: #[N] — [Why this is the top pick]

Which theme for [Month]?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

# Phase 3: GACCS Brief (Anchor Piece)

Build a full brief for the month's anchor piece using the GACCS framework.

### The GACCS Framework

Every anchor piece needs five elements defined upfront:

| Element | Question | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Goal** | What business outcome does this piece serve? | Connects content to strategy |
| **Audience** | Who specifically is this for? | Prevents "everyone" thinking |
| **Creative** | What's the angle, format, and hook? | Ensures differentiation |
| **Channels** | Where will this be published and distributed? | Prevents "publish and pray" |
| **Stakeholders** | Who needs to review, contribute, or approve? | Prevents bottlenecks |

### GACCS Brief Workshop

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
GACCS BRIEF — [Month] Anchor Piece
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Theme: [Selected theme]

GOAL: What should this piece achieve?
  Options: Build awareness, establish expertise, generate leads,
  start conversations, drive sign-ups
  → [User input or pre-fill from strategy]

AUDIENCE: Who is this piece FOR?
  Be specific — role, stage, mindset.
  → [User input or pre-fill from ICP]

CREATIVE: What's the angle?
  - Working title: ___
  - Format: [Essay / Guide / Framework / Case study / Manifesto]
  - Hook concept: [What makes someone stop and read?]
  - Core argument: [The one thing the reader should believe after reading]

CHANNELS: Where does this go?
  - Primary: [From Tier 1 defaults]
  - Extended: [From Tier 2 — which channels for this specific piece?]
  - Amplification: [From Tier 3 — is this piece worth paid/outreach?]

STAKEHOLDERS: Who's involved?
  - Writer: [DRI]
  - Reviewer: [If applicable]
  - Design: [If visual assets needed]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Display Format

```markdown
## GACCS Brief — [Month] Anchor

**Title:** [Working title]
**Theme:** [Monthly theme]
**Pillar:** [Content pillar]

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Goal** | [Specific goal] |
| **Audience** | [Specific audience] |
| **Creative** | [Format + hook + core argument] |
| **Channels** | Tier 1: [channels] / Tier 2: [channels] / Tier 3: [channels] |
| **Stakeholders** | Writer: [X] / Reviewer: [X] |

**Publish Target:** [Week of month + day]

Confirm brief or adjust?
```

# Phase 4: 4-Week Calendar Build

Map content across 4 weeks using the show definitions from strategy.

### Calendar Generation Logic

For each week:
1. Map shows to the weekly schedule (from strategy or defaults)
2. Tie each piece to the monthly theme (different angle per week)
3. Designate the anchor piece week (usually Week 1 or 2)
4. Include redistribution slots (at least 2/month)
5. Include flex slots (1-2/month for reactive/timely content)

### Constraint Enforcement

**Before generating, check these rules:**

| Constraint | Rule | What Happens if Violated |
|-----------|------|------------------------|
| **Max pieces/week** | ≤ 5 new pieces per week | Push back: "That's [N] pieces in Week [X]. Which one should we drop or move?" |
| **30% juice rule** | ≤ 30% product-focused pieces in the month | Warn: "[N]% of pieces are product-focused. That's above the 30% guideline. Which ones should shift to educational?" |
| **Redistribution** | ≥ 2 redistribution slots per month | Warn: "No redistribution slots. Which weeks should feature existing content instead of new?" |
| **Anchor derivatives** | Anchor must generate ≥ 3 derivative pieces | Warn: "Only [N] derivatives from the anchor. Add mileage slots." |
| **Flex slots** | 1-2 slots/month for reactive content | Note: "No flex slots. Consider leaving 1 slot open for timely content." |

### Display Format

```markdown
## [Month Year] Content Calendar

**Theme:** [Monthly theme]
**Anchor Piece:** [Title]
**Pillar:** [Primary pillar]

### Week 1: [Date Range]

| Day | Type | Title/Topic | Platform | Status |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Sat | Flagship Essay | [Title — angle for week 1] | Substack + Twitter | New |
| Mon | Engagement | [Topic] | LinkedIn + Twitter | New |
| Wed | Visual | [Visual concept] | LinkedIn + Twitter | New |
| Thu | Promo/Lead Magnet | [Topic] | LinkedIn + Twitter | New |

### Week 2: [Date Range]

| Day | Type | Title/Topic | Platform | Status |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Sat | Flagship Essay | [Title — angle for week 2] | Substack + Twitter | New |
| Mon | Engagement | [Topic] | LinkedIn + Twitter | Redistribute |
| Wed | Visual | [Visual concept] | LinkedIn + Twitter | New |
| Thu | Promo/Lead Magnet | [Topic] | LinkedIn + Twitter | New |

### Week 3: [Date Range]
[Same format]

### Week 4: [Date Range]
[Same format]

---

**Production Summary:**
- Total new pieces: [N]
- Redistributed pieces: [N]
- Flex slots: [N]
- Product-focused: [N/total] ([%]) — [OK / Warning]
- Anchor derivatives: [N] — [OK / Warning]
```

---

# Phase 5: Distribution Plan

Assign distribution tiers and channels to each piece on the calendar.

### Default Assignment

Using distribution tier defaults from content strategy:
- **All pieces:** Tier 1 channels (publish on primary platforms)
- **Strong pieces:** Add Tier 2 channels (extended distribution)
- **Anchor + best performer:** Tier 3 channels (paid/outreach amplification)

### Display Format

```markdown
## Distribution Plan — [Month]

### Tier 1 (Every Piece)
All [N] pieces publish to: [Tier 1 channel list]

### Tier 2 (Extended — [N] pieces)
| Piece | Additional Channels | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| [Title] | [Channels] | [Rationale] |
| [Title] | [Channels] | [Rationale] |

### Tier 3 (Amplification — [N] pieces)
| Piece | Amplification | Budget | Expected Reach |
|-------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| [Anchor piece] | [Channel — e.g., TL Ads] | [Budget] | [Estimate] |

Confirm distribution plan or adjust?
```

---

# Phase 6: Mileage Map

Plan the repurposing chain for the anchor piece.

### The Mileage Principle

One excellent piece of content should generate 3+ derivative pieces. This is how you get more mileage without more effort.

### Mileage Map Template

```markdown
## Mileage Map — [Anchor Piece Title]

**Source:** [Anchor piece — format, word count, platform]

### Derivative Chain

[Anchor Piece]
  ├── Social excerpt 1 → LinkedIn (key insight, 150 words)
  ├── Social excerpt 2 → Twitter thread (3-5 tweets)
  ├── Visual framework → LinkedIn + Twitter (infographic from core model)
  ├── Engagement post → LinkedIn (poll or hot take from contrarian angle)
  ├── Email teaser → Newsletter (excerpt + link)
  └── [Optional] Guest pitch → [Publication] (reframe for their audience)

### Derivative Details

| # | Derivative | Platform | Source Section | Publish Date |
|---|-----------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Description] | [Platform] | [Which part of anchor] | [Date] |
| 2 | [Description] | [Platform] | [Which part of anchor] | [Date] |
| 3 | [Description] | [Platform] | [Which part of anchor] | [Date] |

**Total mileage:** 1 anchor → [N] derivatives
```

---

# Phase 7: Existing Content Check

Identify content to redistribute (not just new creation).

### The "Default to Less" Principle

Before creating new content for every slot, check what already exists that could be:
- **Reshared** — High-performing past content shared again (with new intro)
- **Updated** — Older content refreshed with new data or examples
- **Reframed** — Same core idea, different angle or format
- **Compiled** — Multiple related pieces combined into a guide

### Existing Content Workshop

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EXISTING CONTENT — What Can We Redistribute?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Think about content you've already published that:

1. PERFORMED WELL — What got the most engagement/shares/replies?
   →

2. IS STILL RELEVANT — What older piece is just as true today?
   →

3. FITS THE THEME — What existing content connects to "[theme]"?
   →

4. DESERVES A SECOND LIFE — What did you put work into but didn't get enough reach?
   →

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Slot Assignment

After user responds, assign redistribution content to specific calendar slots:

```markdown
## Redistribution Slots — [Month]

| Week | Day | Original Piece | Redistribution Type | New Angle |
|------|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [W] | [Day] | "[Original title]" | Reshare / Update / Reframe | [How it's repackaged] |
| [W] | [Day] | "[Original title]" | Reshare / Update / Reframe | [How it's repackaged] |

**New vs. Redistributed:** [N] new / [N] redistributed = [ratio]
```

---

# Phase 8: Export to Production

After calendar approval, export to production systems for tracking and scheduling.

### Step 1: Production Database

Push the calendar to your content tracking system — one card per content piece + associated assets.

"Push to your content database? This creates one card per content piece + associated assets for monthly visibility."

This creates:
- Content items with: show, channel, pillar, publish date, CTA, status
- Asset items for every deliverable (linked to parent content)
- Status tracking: To Produce → Produced → Scheduled → Published

### Step 2: Bulk Production Sessions

Produce content by channel/format (not weekly):

1. **Session 1:** All long-form articles — use `/writing`
2. **Session 2:** All social posts — use `/writing`
3. **Session 3:** All visuals — use `/visual-content`
4. **Session 4:** All assets (lead magnets, downloadables, offers)

As each piece is produced, update status to "Produced."

### Step 3: Push to Platforms

After production is complete, publish via your preferred tool (e.g., Metricool, Buffer, Publer for social; Ghost, Substack, WordPress for articles).

After pushing, update status to "Scheduled."

# Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Monthly theme is specific enough to guide 4 weeks of content
- [ ] GACCS brief has all 5 elements filled (no blanks)
- [ ] Max 5 new pieces per week (constraint enforced)
- [ ] At most 30% product-focused pieces (juice rule enforced)
- [ ] At least 2 redistribution slots in the month
- [ ] Anchor piece generates 3+ derivatives (mileage map complete)
- [ ] 1-2 flex slots left for reactive/timely content
- [ ] Every piece has a distribution tier assigned
- [ ] Calendar connects to content strategy pillars and perceptions
- [ ] Production dates are realistic

---

# Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

**DON'T:**
- Plan 7+ new pieces per week ("just to have options")
- Make every piece product-focused (violates 30% rule)
- Create all new content with zero redistribution
- Build a calendar disconnected from content strategy
- Skip the GACCS brief ("I'll figure it out when I write it")
- Treat the mileage map as optional
- Fill every slot — leave room for reactive content

**DO:**
- Start with the anchor piece and derive everything else
- Enforce constraints — they protect quality
- Include redistribution slots every month
- Connect every piece to the monthly theme
- Use the GACCS brief to prevent "blank page" syndrome
- Leave flex slots for timely content
- Track what performs for next month's redistribution

---

# Quick Actions

After running `/content-calendar`:

- "Adjust theme to [X]" → Regenerates calendar with new theme
- "Swap [piece] for [piece]" → Moves content between weeks/slots
- "Add a campaign overlay" → Integrates `/content-campaign` into the calendar
- "Generate GACCS for Week [N]" → Builds brief for a non-anchor piece
- "Show mileage for [piece]" → Builds repurposing chain for any piece
- "Flag as product-focused" → Re-checks 30% juice rule
- "Export to production DB" → Creates production cards in your content database
