# ICP & Personas

Define Ideal Customer Profiles and buyer personas using workflow-based segmentation. Produces ICP definition, persona cards, customer journey maps, and research frameworks.

**When to use:** After positioning strategy is defined. Takes the primary segment from positioning and goes deeper on who the target customer is, how they buy, and what their journey looks like.

**Prerequisite:** Run `/positioning-strategy` first, or have positioning context ready.

---

## Philosophy

This skill is **opinionated**. ICPs built on firmographics alone ("US companies, $50M revenue, 500 employees") miss the most important element: **the workflow**.

**Core principle:** Companies buy software to support work they're doing (or planning to do). If they don't do the workflow your product supports, they won't buy — no matter how well they match your firmographics.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
/icp-personas runs:

1. POSITIONING CHECK  → Load positioning context (segment, anchor, differentiation)
2. WORKFLOW DEFINE    → Define the core workflow/use case
3. ICP BUILD          → Layer firmographics + problems onto workflow
4. PERSONA CREATE     → Build buyer/user persona cards
5. JOURNEY MAP        → Map awareness → consideration → decision
6. RESEARCH FRAME     → Provide validation framework
```

# Phase 1: Load Discovery & Positioning Context

Before building ICPs, load the discovery and positioning context.

### Check for Discovery Artifact

Look for: `projects/[project-name]/discovery-intake.md`

**If found:**
Extract:
- Core workflow (critical for ICP)
- Current/target customers
- Alternatives
- Why they win

**If not found:**
Display: "I need business context first. Please run `/discovery-intake` to collect the foundation."
Stop and wait.

### Check for Positioning Artifact

Look for: `projects/[project-name]/positioning-strategy.md`

**If found:**
Extract:
- Primary anchor
- Core differentiation
- One-sentence positioning
- Primary segment (if ICP Scorecard was run)

**If not found:**
Display: "I recommend running `/positioning-strategy` first so ICP is grounded in positioning. Proceed without positioning context? [Yes/No]"

If user says yes, proceed with discovery context only.

---

# Phase 2: Workflow Definition

**This is the most critical element of your ICP.**

Most ICPs skip the workflow and jump to firmographics. This is backwards. The workflow determines whether someone will ever consider buying.

### The Workflow Question

```markdown
## Workflow Definition

**The core question:** What work is someone doing (or planning to do) when they would use your product?

Be specific about the ACTIVITY, not the outcome.

❌ "Grow revenue" (outcome, not workflow)
❌ "Run marketing" (too broad)
✅ "Write and send cold outbound emails at scale"
✅ "Build a go-to-market strategy for a new product"
✅ "Track and analyze product usage data"
```

### Workflow Capture

Ask and wait for response:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WORKFLOW DEFINITION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. WHAT WORKFLOW DOES YOUR PRODUCT SUPPORT?
   Describe the specific activities/tasks, not business outcomes.

2. WHO PERFORMS THIS WORKFLOW?
   What's their title? What team are they on?

3. HOW OFTEN DO THEY DO IT?
   Daily? Weekly? Quarterly? One-time project?

4. WHAT TRIGGERS THE WORKFLOW?
   What event or situation causes them to do this work?

5. WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T DO IT (OR DO IT POORLY)?
   What's at stake?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Workflow Width Analysis

After capturing workflow:

| Width | Description | Example | Implication |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Narrow** | Single specific task | "Score inbound leads" | Larger TAM, lower ACV, PLG-friendly |
| **Medium** | Related set of tasks | "Manage outbound sales pipeline" | Balanced approach |
| **Wide** | End-to-end process | "Run entire sales organization" | Smaller TAM, higher ACV, needs strong proof |

Recommend where this workflow falls and what it means for GTM.

# Phase 3: ICP Build

Layer additional elements onto the workflow foundation.

### The ICP Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          FIRMOGRAPHICS              │  ← Least important (but useful for targeting)
│   Company size, industry, geo       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│            PROBLEMS                 │  ← What pain do they have with current approach?
│   Specific frustrations, gaps       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE        │  ← What do they use today?
│   From positioning anchor           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           WORKFLOW                  │  ← Most important
│   The work they're doing            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### ICP Definition Questions

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ICP DEFINITION — Building on Workflow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You've defined the workflow. Now let's add layers.

COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE (from positioning):
→ [Pre-fill from positioning anchor]

PROBLEMS WITH THE ALTERNATIVE:
1. What specific frustrations do they have?
2. What are they NOT able to do with the current approach?
3. What triggers them to look for something better?

FIRMOGRAPHICS (optional refinement):
- Company size: [Range or "any"]
- Industry: [Specific or "any"]
- Geography: [Specific or "any"]
- Stage: [Startup, growth, enterprise]
- Tech stack: [Any relevant technologies]

BUYING SIGNALS:
- What indicates someone is actively in-market?
- What event or change triggers the buying process?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### ICP Statement Format

```markdown
## ICP Definition

**Core ICP Statement:**
[Role] at [company type] who [workflow] using [current alternative] and struggles with [specific problem].

**Workflow:** [The work they're doing]
**Alternative:** [What they use today]
**Problem:** [Why the alternative isn't working]
**Trigger:** [What causes them to look for a solution]

**Firmographic Filters (if applicable):**
- Company size: [X]
- Industry: [X]
- Geography: [X]

**Buying Signals:**
- [Signal 1]
- [Signal 2]
```

---

# Phase 4: Persona Development

Build persona cards for the key players in the buying process.

### The Buying Committee

Most B2B purchases involve multiple people:

| Role | Description | Key Question |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **User** | Person who uses the product daily | "Will this make my job easier?" |
| **Champion** | Internal advocate who pushes for purchase | "Will this make me look good?" |
| **Decision Maker** | Person who approves budget/signs contract | "Is this worth the investment?" |
| **Influencer** | Person whose opinion matters | "Does this fit our standards?" |

### Targeting Decision Framework

Determine primary marketing target based on product and sales motion:

| Factor | User Focus | Middle Mgmt Focus | C-Suite Focus |
|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| ACV | < $10K | $10K-100K | > $100K |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Behavior change | Individual | Team | Org-wide |
| Sales cycle | Self-serve | 1-3 months | 3-12 months |
| Champion | User IS champion | User recruits champion | Champion is exec |

Ask:
> "Based on your product and sales motion, who should be the PRIMARY target of your marketing: the end user, middle management, or C-suite?"

### Persona Card Template

For each relevant persona, build:

```markdown
## Persona: [Role Name]

**Title examples:** [2-3 common titles]
**Reports to:** [Their manager's role]
**Team size:** [If they manage people]

### Day in the Life
- [Morning routine / priorities]
- [Key tasks they're responsible for]
- [Meetings they attend]
- [Tools they use daily]

### Goals & Motivations
- **Professional:** [What they're trying to achieve at work]
- **Personal:** [Career aspirations, how they want to be seen]
- **Metrics:** [What they're measured on]

### Frustrations & Pain Points
- [Pain 1 — related to your product's value]
- [Pain 2]
- [Pain 3]

### Information Sources
- **Where they learn:** [Podcasts, newsletters, communities]
- **Who they trust:** [Thought leaders, peers, analysts]
- **How they research:** [Google, peer recommendations, G2/Capterra]

### Objections & Concerns
- [Objection 1] → [How to address]
- [Objection 2] → [How to address]

### Messaging That Resonates
- **Hook:** [What gets their attention]
- **Value prop:** [What makes them lean in]
- **Proof:** [What makes them believe]
```

# Phase 5: Customer Journey Mapping

Map the journey from unaware to customer.

### Journey Stages

| Stage | Mindset | Goal | Key Question |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know they have the problem | Create awareness | "What problem?" |
| **Problem Aware** | Knows the problem, not seeking solution | Educate on severity | "Is this a big deal?" |
| **Solution Aware** | Seeking solutions | Differentiate | "What are my options?" |
| **Product Aware** | Evaluating your product | Build confidence | "Why you specifically?" |
| **Decision** | Ready to buy | Remove friction | "What do I need to do?" |

### Journey Map Template

```markdown
## Customer Journey Map

### Stage 1: Unaware → Problem Aware

**Trigger:** [What event makes them realize they have a problem?]

**Content needs:**
- [Type of content that resonates]
- [Channels where they'd encounter it]

**Key message:** [What do they need to hear?]

**Success metric:** [How do you know they've moved to next stage?]

---

### Stage 2: Problem Aware → Solution Aware

**Trigger:** [What makes them start seeking solutions?]

**Content needs:**
- [Educational content, comparisons, frameworks]
- [Channels]

**Key message:** [What do they need to hear?]

**Success metric:** [How do you know they've moved?]

---

### Stage 3: Solution Aware → Product Aware

**Trigger:** [What puts you on their radar?]

**Content needs:**
- [Product-specific content, demos, case studies]
- [Channels]

**Key message:** [What do they need to hear?]

# Phase 6: Research & Validation Framework

Provide a framework for validating ICP assumptions.

### Research Questions

```markdown
## ICP Validation Framework

### Questions to Answer

**Workflow Validation:**
- Do they actually do this workflow? How often?
- How important is this workflow to their job?
- What happens if it's done poorly?

**Problem Validation:**
- Do they experience the problems we hypothesize?
- How severe are these problems? (1-10)
- Have they tried to solve them before?

**Alternative Validation:**
- What do they currently use?
- What do they like about it?
- What do they wish was different?

**Buying Process Validation:**
- Who else is involved in decisions like this?
- What would trigger them to look for something new?
- What would make them NOT buy?
```

### Research Methods

| Method | Best For | Sample Size | Effort |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Customer interviews** | Deep insight, quotes | 5-10 | High |
| **Sales call analysis** | Objections, language | 10-20 calls | Medium |
| **Survey** | Validation at scale | 50-100 | Medium |
| **Win/loss analysis** | Why they chose you (or didn't) | 10-20 | Medium |
| **Support ticket review** | Real problems, language | 50+ tickets | Low |

### Interview Script Template

```markdown
## ICP Validation Interview Script (30 min)

**Intro (2 min):**
"Thanks for chatting. I'm trying to understand how [role] like yourself think about [workflow]. No sales pitch — just learning."

**Workflow Questions (10 min):**
1. Walk me through how you currently [workflow].
2. How often do you do this? What triggers it?
3. What tools or processes do you use?
4. What's the hardest part?

**Problem Questions (10 min):**
5. What frustrates you most about your current approach?
6. If you could wave a magic wand, what would you fix?
7. Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?
8. How much time/money does this problem cost you?

**Buying Questions (5 min):**
9. If you were looking for a better solution, where would you start?
10. Who else would be involved in evaluating options?
11. What would make you NOT try something new?

**Wrap (3 min):**
"Super helpful. Anything else I should know about how [role] think about this?"
```

# Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] ICP is workflow-based (not just firmographics)
- [ ] Workflow is specific (activities, not outcomes)
- [ ] Problems are specific and felt (not abstract)
- [ ] Persona includes information sources and research habits
- [ ] Journey map has clear triggers between stages
- [ ] Research framework is actionable (not just "do more research")
- [ ] Output connects back to positioning (consistent story)

---

# Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

**DON'T:**
- Build ICP on firmographics alone ("US companies, $50M revenue")
- Skip the workflow definition
- Create persona cards that are just demographics
- Map a journey without clear stage triggers
- Assume you know the ICP without validation plan

**DO:**
- Start with workflow, layer everything else on top
- Include competitive alternative in ICP definition
- Make personas feel like real people (day-in-life, frustrations)
- Define what content is needed at each journey stage
- Provide a framework for validating assumptions

---
