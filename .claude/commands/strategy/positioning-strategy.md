# Positioning Strategy

Build competitive positioning strategy using JTBD-based positioning methodology. Produces competitive landscape, primary anchor selection, differentiation analysis, and positioning narrative.

**When to use:** When developing B2B positioning strategy for a product or company. This skill helps technical founders who can build but struggle with distribution.

---

## Philosophy

This skill is **opinionated**. It makes recommendations, not just asks questions. The goal is to replicate what a $400K/year CMO would deliver: clear strategic direction that makes all downstream tactics work better.

**Core principle:** You can't win with a bloated message. You get 10 seconds, not 30 minutes. Choose ONE primary anchor and tell a clear, compelling story of why you're better.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
/positioning-strategy runs:

1. DISCOVERY       → Collect business context, product, customers
2. JTBD MAPPING    → Map ALL alternatives (not just direct competitors)
3. ANCHOR SELECT   → Choose ONE primary competitive anchor
4. DIFFERENTIATE   → Build differentiation case against anchor
5. SEGMENT SCORE   → Score segments using ICP Scorecard (optional)
6. NARRATIVE       → Produce one-liner, elevator, homepage positioning
```

# Phase 1: Load Discovery Context

Before running positioning, load the discovery context.

### Check for Discovery Artifact

Look for: `projects/[project-name]/discovery-intake.md`

**If found:**
Extract and display:
- One-sentence description
- Core workflow
- Current/target customers
- Customer language (verbatim)
- Alternatives they mentioned
- Why customers choose them

Confirm with user: "I've loaded your discovery context. Ready to proceed with positioning?"

**If not found:**
Display: "I need business context before we can build positioning. Please run `/discovery-intake` first to collect the foundation."

Stop and wait for user to run discovery.

# Phase 2: JTBD Competitive Landscape Mapping

**This is the critical insight most founders miss.**

Most markets are fragmented. Competition is rarely a fellow startup. Only with a JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) lens can you uncover your real competition.

### The Four Competition Categories

Map ALL alternatives customers have for the same job:

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **DIY/Manual** | Internal teams doing it themselves | Spreadsheets, manual processes, in-house builds |
| **Bent Legacy** | Tools not designed for this but stretched to work | Enterprise software hacked for the use case |
| **Agencies/Services** | Work outsourced to humans | Consultants, freelancers, agencies |
| **Direct Competitors** | Software built for the same job | Other startups, established SaaS |

### Mapping Process

For each alternative the user mentioned (or you infer):

1. **Name the alternative** — What do they actually call it?
2. **Why customers choose it** — What's the appeal?
3. **What job it solves** — Same job or adjacent?
4. **Its limitations** — What problem does it create?
5. **How common is it** — Is this what MOST of the market does?

### Display Format

```markdown
## Competitive Landscape (JTBD View)

**Job to be done:** [The core workflow/task]

### 1. DIY/Manual Approaches
- [Alternative]: [Why chosen] → Problem: [Limitation]

### 2. Bent Legacy Tools
- [Alternative]: [Why chosen] → Problem: [Limitation]

### 3. Agencies/Services
- [Alternative]: [Why chosen] → Problem: [Limitation]

### 4. Direct Competitors
- [Alternative]: [Why chosen] → Problem: [Limitation]

**Key Insight:** [Where is most of the market today?]
```

### Critical Reminder

> The trap many founders fall into is looking at the market ONLY through a category lens. They fixate on magic quadrants, analyst reports, and other VC-backed startups.
>
> **This is often a big mistake.** Because most of the market isn't even aware of these tools, let alone actively evaluating them.

# Phase 3: Primary Anchor Selection

**You must choose ONE primary anchor to position against.**

Your differentiation story will be completely different depending on which alternative you choose. You can't combine all value arguments into one message — that results in generic, bloated, forgettable positioning.

### The Decision Framework

Ask these questions to identify the primary anchor:

1. **Where is the majority of your target market today?**
   - Are they using DIY approaches? Agencies? Legacy tools? Nothing?
   - The biggest opportunity is often where the most people are stuck

2. **Which alternative creates the problem your product solves best?**
   - Your strongest differentiation emerges from a specific anchor
   - If you try to differentiate against everything, you differentiate against nothing

3. **Which alternative will resonate in 10 seconds?**
   - Marketing doesn't give you 30 minutes to explain tradeoffs
   - The anchor must be immediately recognizable to your audience

### Present the Recommendation

```markdown
## Primary Anchor Selection

**Recommended Primary Anchor:** [The alternative]

**Why this anchor:**
- [Reason 1 — where the market is]
- [Reason 2 — differentiation strength]
- [Reason 3 — recognition/resonance]

**What this means for positioning:**
[1-2 sentences on how this shapes the story]

**Secondary anchors to address in sales (not marketing):**
- [Anchor 2] — when [situation]
- [Anchor 3] — when [situation]

---
Confirm or adjust? The rest of the positioning builds from this choice.
```

### Get Confirmation

Wait for user to confirm or adjust before proceeding. This is a strategic bet — they need to own it.

---

# Phase 4: Differentiation Analysis

With the primary anchor selected, build the differentiation case.

### The Differentiation Framework

Answer three questions relative to the anchor:

**1. What's the specific problem with the anchor?**
- Not abstract complaints — specific, felt pain
- Use language customers would use
- The problem must be owned by someone (not a cross-functional mess)

**2. How are you meaningfully better?**
- Not feature lists — outcomes and capabilities
- "10x better" is ideal, but be honest about actual advantage
- Differentiation can be: speed, price, depth, specialization, integration, approach

**3. What proof supports this claim?**
- Customer quotes
- Performance data
- Case studies
- Specific examples

### Display Format

```markdown
## Differentiation Analysis

**Primary Anchor:** [The alternative you're positioning against]

### The Problem with [Anchor]
[2-3 specific problems, using customer language]

### How [Product] is Better
[2-3 differentiation points, each with a "so what" outcome]

### Proof Points
[2-3 pieces of evidence: quotes, data, examples]

### Differentiation Summary
**One sentence:** [Product] is [key differentiator] compared to [anchor], which means [outcome for customer].
```

---

# Phase 5: ICP Segment Scoring (Optional)

If the user has multiple potential segments or is unsure where to focus, use the ICP Scorecard.

**Skip this phase if:** The user has one clear segment or already knows their focus.

### The Four Scoring Criteria

| Criterion | Question | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Problem Severity** | Is there a compelling reason to buy? | Most important. If weak, the market may not exist. |
| **Differentiation** | Are we significantly better than the alternative? | If weak, narrow the segment or change the product. |
| **Access** | Can we easily get in front of them? | Great product + no access = bad product. |
| **Size** | Does this segment support short-term revenue goals? | Least important. Momentum > maximizing TAM. |

### Scoring Process

For each segment:
1. Score each criterion: Strong / Medium / Weak
2. Add brief rationale for each score
3. Identify the highest-scoring segment

### Display Format

```markdown
## ICP Segment Scoring

| Segment | Problem Severity | Differentiation | Access | Size | Recommendation |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------|------|----------------|
| [Seg 1] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Primary/Secondary/Deprioritize] |
| [Seg 2] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Primary/Secondary/Deprioritize] |

### Scoring Rationale

**[Segment 1]:**
- Problem Severity: [Why this score]
- Differentiation: [Why this score]
- Access: [Why this score]
- Size: [Why this score]

**Recommendation:** [Which segment to prioritize and why]
```

### Critical Reminder

> The name of the game is NOT to maximize revenue, it's to maximize momentum (growth). Size is the least important criterion.

# Phase 6: Positioning Narrative

Build the positioning narrative at three levels of detail.

### The Narrative Ladder

**Level 1: One-Sentence Explanation**
- What you are in the simplest terms
- Should pass the "tell it to a friend" test

**Level 2: Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)**
- One-liner + the problem you solve + why you're different
- Should work in 30 seconds

**Level 3: Homepage-Ready Positioning**
- Full positioning statement ready to inform homepage copy
- Includes: hero message, problem framing, differentiation, and social proof structure

### Generate the Narrative

```markdown
## Positioning Narrative

### One-Sentence Explanation
[What you are in simplest terms — no jargon, no buzzwords]

### Elevator Pitch
[Product] helps [target customer] [achieve outcome].

Unlike [primary anchor], [Product] [key differentiator], which means [benefit in customer terms].

### Homepage-Ready Positioning

**Hero Message:**
[Headline that captures the core value proposition]

**Subhead:**
[1-2 sentences expanding on the hero, introducing the problem]

**Problem Framing:**
[The anchor] [creates this problem]. [Specific pain point]. [Impact on customer].

**Solution Framing:**
[Product] [how it solves the problem]. [Key differentiator]. [Outcome].

**Supporting Messages:**
1. [Differentiator 1] — [Benefit]
2. [Differentiator 2] — [Benefit]
3. [Differentiator 3] — [Benefit]

**Social Proof Structure:**
- [Type of proof to feature: logos, quotes, metrics]
- [Specific proof point if available]
```

# Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Competitive landscape includes ALL alternatives (not just direct competitors)
- [ ] Primary anchor is explicitly chosen and justified
- [ ] Differentiation is relative to the anchor (not generic "we're better")
- [ ] Problem is specific and owned by someone (not cross-functional mess)
- [ ] One-sentence explanation passes the "tell a friend" test
- [ ] Positioning narrative is specific (not generic platitudes)
- [ ] No buzzword bingo: "leverage," "synergy," "cutting-edge," "revolutionary"
- [ ] Output is Notion-exportable and demo-ready

---

# Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

**DON'T:**
- Skip JTBD mapping and jump straight to "versus competitors"
- Try to position against all alternatives at once
- Use business outcomes as differentiators ("increase revenue")
- Create positioning that spans multiple departments with no owner
- Include 10+ use cases (that's hedging, not positioning)
- Use jargon that requires explanation

**DO:**
- Start from where the market actually is (often manual/DIY)
- Choose ONE primary anchor and commit
- Use customer language, not marketing speak
- Ensure the problem is owned and felt by a specific person
- Make the differentiation concrete and provable
- Keep it simple enough to pass the 10-second test
